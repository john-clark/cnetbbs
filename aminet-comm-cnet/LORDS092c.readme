SYSOP/PLAYER:

	I AM WRITING THIS COMPENDIUM AS THE UNREGISTERED VERSION OF "THE
EARTH LORDS" IS BEING TESTED. I INTEND TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE UNREGISTERED
RELEASE AS A MEANS BY WHICH THE PLAYER OR SYSOP MAY UNDERSTAND THE INNER
WORKINGS OF "THE EARTH LORDS" IN BOTH THE REGISTERED AND UNREGISTERED
FORM. THE REALM IS FAIRLY VAST SO I AM GOING TO BEGIN WITH A SMALL
ANOUNCEMENT WRITTEN BELOW SO THAT IT WILL CATCH YOUR EYE.


  ***********************************************************************
  ***** THE REGISTERED VERSION OF "THE EARTH LORDS" SHOULD BE READY *****
  ***** BY MAY 1ST, 1994. I AM WORKING HARD ON THE MAPS BUT THERE   *****
  ***** ARE OVER 80  DIFFERENT MAPS AND SO SOME TIME IS NEEDED. SEE *****
  ***** THE INFORMATION AT THE END OF THIS FILE FOR MORE INFORMATION*****
  ***********************************************************************

  ***********************************************************************
  ***** DID THAT CATCH YOUR EYE? WELL SINCE I AM RELEASING THIS FILE ****
  ***** NOW AND THE REGISTERED IS ALMOST FINISHED AND READY FOR TEST-****
  ***** ING I DECIDED TO GIVE YOU A LIST OF SOME OF THE THINGS YOU   ****
  ***** WILL FIND ONLY IN THE REGISTERED VERSION. THIS MAY HELP YOU  ****
  ***** DECIDE ON ITS VALUE AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT IT. THANKS!  ****
  ***********************************************************************

BEFORE WE START HERE ARE SOME COMING ATTRACTIONS FROM THE REGISTERED VERSION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1> 12 MISSIONS/ 10 QUESTS & 1 FINAL CONFLICT (THAT IS 23 THINGS I GUESS)
2> 350 MONSTERS (MORE REALLY)
3> 100+ MAPS INCLUDING THE FABLED 9 STORIED FORTRESS OF LANSAGUL AS WELL
	AS THE EIGHT OTHER ASTRAL REALMS
4> MORE PICTURES/ RIDDLES/ ANIMATIONS
5> THE ENEMY WILL SOMETIMES ATTACK YOUR MOUNT INSTEAD OF YOU
6> THE REALLY BIG OFFENSIVE WEAPONS ARE IN FOR YOU TO FIND
7> ALL THE SPECIAL ABILITIES AND MUNDANE SKILLS WORK
8> WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE TELEPORT & ASTRAL TRAVEL ANIM...GROOVY
9> THE MEANEST MONSTERS AND SPECIAL ENEMIES ARE ALL WAITING HERE
10> I ADDED SO MANY EXTRA FEATURES I CAN'T REMEMBER THEM ALL NOW
11> A LOT OF THINGS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITHIN SO JUST READ ON AND
	CHECK OUT EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THE REGISTERED VERSION AS WELL!!!


	
	SO WHAT IS THIS? WELL THIS IS THE COMPENDIUM. IT IS WRITTEN MOSTLY
FOR SYSOPS BUT A PLAYER COULD HAVE ACCESS TO IT AS WELL SO THAT THEY WILL
COMPREHEND THE COMMANDS AND INNER WORKINGS OF THE GAME. OF COURSE THIS
PIECE IS BASED MOSTLY ON THE REGISTERED VERSION OF "THE EARTH LORDS" SO
SOME INFORMATION WILL NOT APPLY TO THE UNREGISTERED VERSION. ALSO, IF
THE SYSOP BUYS THE DELUXE REGISTERED VERSION WHICH INCLUDES A COMPLETE
CONSTRUCTION SET THEN MOST OF THIS INFORMATION WILL NOT APPLY TO HIS OR
HER COMPAIGN BECAUSE IT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE DIFFERENT IN MANY ASPECTS FROM
THE ONE I CREATED. 

	NOTE:
	THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS BASED ON THE REGISTERED VERSION. IF THE
VERSION YOU ARE PLAYING DOES NOT HAVE ALL OF THESE FEATURES THEN IT IS
NOT THE REGISTERED VERSION. SORRY, BUT THIS MANNER HELPS ME TO SHOW YOU
THE FULL RELEASE AND KEEPS ME FROM HAVING TO WRITE (REGISTERED ONLY) AFTER
EVERY OTHER LINE. NOTICE THAT THE UNREGISTERED VERSION CONTAINS 3 MISSIONS
1 IMPOSSIBLE QUEST AND 30 MAPS BUT IT IS NOT WINNABLE. IT ALSO LACKS ALL
THE MONSTERS FOUND IN THE REGISTERED VERSION AND SOME OF THE MORE COMPLEX
SQUARES DO NOT EXIST. HOWEVER, THE UNREGISTERED VERSION IS VERY FUN AND
IS LARGER THAN THE "REGISTERED BATTLE LANDS" SO IF YOU THINK IN THESE TERMS
THEN YOU WILL NOT FEEL RIPPED OFF BY NOT HAVING THE REGISTERED VERSION OF
"THE EARTH LORDS". HOWEVER, IF YOU WANNA BE ABLE TO DO AND SEE ALL THE
THINGS WRITTEN BELOW THEN ENCOURAGE REGISTRY OR REGISTER IT YOURSELF.

 ***********************************************************************

	LO' YOUNG ADVENTURER A SEAT AWAITS THY BIDDING. LONG AGO A COUNCIL
WAS FORMED OF ALL THE LANDS OF THE EARTH. THIS COUNCIL WAS ASSEMBLED
OF THE KINGS AND LORDS OF THE EARTH AND WAS GATHERED AS A POSITION TO
DISOLVE THE EVIL THAN RAN AMUCK ON THEIR PLANET, THEIR EARTH. FOR
GENERATIONS THE COUNCIL OF EARTH LORDS OVERSAW THE LAWS OF NATIONS AND
KEPT PEACE AND HARMONY IN THE WORLD.

	AFTER A WHILE THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A NEED FOR THE VARIOUS RACES
TO SEND THEIR LEADERS TO THE COUNCIL SEATS BECAUSE THE POWER THE COUNCIL
EXHUMED WAS SO GREAT THAT NO EVIL DARED TO THREATEN THE EARTH. EVENTUALLY,
THE NUMBERS OF THE COUNCIL BEGAN TO GET LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL THE HALL
EXISTED AS A MERE FABLE AND LEGEND. THE NEXT ACT OF AGRESSION AGAINST 
ANOTHER RACE OR TOWNSHIP HAPPENED MANY YEARS AFTER THE COUNCIL HAD
DISOLVED. THIS ACT WENT UNCHECKED. THERE WAS TO BE GREAT RETRIBUTION AND
PUNISHMENT IN THE PAST FOR SUCH THINGS BUT THIS TIME NOTHING HAPPENED.
IT SEEMS THE LAST OF THE EARTH LORDS HAD PASSED ON.

	EVIL NEVER DIES AND NOW IT SAW A TIME TO REEP IT'S VENGENCE ACROSS
THE LAND FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN EVIL'S PAST. THE CREATURES OF DARKNESS
WERE TIRED OF BEING BANISHED TO FAR AWAY LANDS AND NOW IT SEEMED THE HAD
THEIR OLD RULE BACK. 

	DECADES PASSED AND EVIL BECAME STRONGER. THE MAIN CITY OF THE LANDS
DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO SEE WHAT TO MAKE OF ALL THIS. THEIR POSITION WAS
ALWAYS BEING THREATENED BY THE MONSTERS OF THE REALM WHO WERE GATHERING
FORCES IN LARGE ARMIES AND HUGE FORTRESSES. FORTUNATELY, THE ELDEST OF
THE COUNCILMEN REMEMBERED A TIME MANY CENTURIES BEFORE WHEN THE PEOPLE OF
THE LAND HAD ELECTED THEIR RULERS TO THE COUNCIL OF THE EARTH LORDS.
DIGGING THROUGH THE ANCIENT TOMES THIS SCHOLAR FOUND THAT CERTAIN THINGS
WERE NECESSARY BEFORE ANYONE COULD ACCEPT A SEAT WITHIN THE HALL OF THE
EARTH LORDS. YOU COULD NOT SIMPLY ACCEPT ELECTION, NO. AN ADVENTURE MUST
TAKE PLACE. AN ADVENTURE WHICH WAS DESIGNED BY THE LAWS TO PRODUCE A 
MASTER OF A CRAFT WHO WOULD LEARN THE WAYS OF THE LAND AND DISCOVER THE
INNER INTIMATE DETAILS OF THE EVIL THAT HAD TAKEN ITS GRIP ON THE PLACE...

 ...AN ADVENTURE DESIGNED TO PRODUCE AN EARTH LORD!

	...AND NOW YOUR ADVENTURE AWAITS...

		...DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BECOME AN EARTH LORD?



 ***********************************************************************
 ************************** T H E   R E A L M **************************
 ***********************************************************************

	THE REALM OF THE EARTH LORDS CONSISTS OF 12 EXTERIOR MAPS. THESE MAPS
CONTAIN 3D ANSI IMAGES OF MOUNTAINS, CASTLES, FORESTS, SWAMPS, RIVERS,
OCEANS, DESERTS, BEACHES AND OTHER SUCH NATURAL FEATURES. ROAMING THE
LANDS ARE A VARIETY OF MONSTERS WHICH CARE NOTHING ABOUT YOUR LITTLE
QUESTS TO SAVE THE CITY STATE FROM UNEARTHLY DISASTER.

1.  WITHOUT CERTAIN AID YOU MAY NOT MOVE OVER OR THROUGH MANY FEATURES
JUST AS YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO IN THE WORLD YOU NOW LIVE IN. AMONG
THESE FEATURES ARE RIVERS, OCEAN, LAKES, MOUNTAINS, WALLS, PITS AND
SO ON. 

2.  MOVING TO THE OPENING OF A BUILDING OR CAVE WILL PLACE YOU INSIDE 
THE STRUCTURE. HOW FAR YOU GO FROM THERE WILL DEPEND UPON WHAT STRUCTURE
YOU ENTERED AND WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR PROGRESS THROUGH THE STRUCTURE.

3. ENCOUNTERS USUALLY ATTACK YOUR CHARACTER IN SIMILAR POWER TO YOUR OWN,
HOWEVER, THERE EXISTS MANY AREAS WHERE CERTAIN CREATURES LIVE AND THEY
DO NOT WANT YOU INVADING THEIR HOMES SO THEY WILL ATTACK REGARDLESS OF
HOW MUCH MORE POWERFUL THEY ARE OR YOU ARE.

4. IN SOME AREAS YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ENTER OR PASS THROUGH
WITHOUT GIVING A PASSWORD OR ANSWERING A RIDDLE. "ALL" PASSWORDS AND
RIDDLE ANSWERS ARE LOCATED SOMEWHERE IN THE GAME. I HAVE PLACED THEM
IN AREAS WHICH I FEEL A NORMAL ADVENTURE OR EXPLORATION OF A STRUCTURE
OR AREA WOULD TAKE A PERSON. NO ANSWER IS HIDDEN IN AREAS WHERE A
CHARACTER WILL REQUIRE CERTAIN SPELLS OR ITEMS TO GET TO.

5. THERE ARE OTHER REALMS WHICH WILL REQUIRE ASTRAL PROJECTION OF SOME
SORT TO REACH. IF YOU EVER HOPE TO BECOME AN EARTH LORD YOU WILL HAVE TO
VISIT THESE PLACES AS PART OF YOUR ADVENTURES. EVEN IF YOU CANNOT CAST
SUCH SPELLS YOU MAY ALWAYS BUY SCROLLS WHICH WILL HELP YOU IN THIS 
RESPECT AND THE MOUNT "TIME STEED" IS ALSO CAPABLE OF ASTRAL TRAVEL.

6. AS YOU TRAVEL YOU HAVE A NOTEBOOK WHICH YOU MAY ENTER PERSONAL
ACCOUNTS AND SECRETS INTO SO THAT YOU DO NOT FORGET THEM OR DON'T HAVE
TO USE YOUR OWN PAPER.

7. SOME AREAS REQUIRE CERTAIN SKILLS TO UNDERSTAND OR MOVE THROUGH SO
KEEP AWARE OF THIS. ALL THE SKILLS ARE USED FOR SOMETHING IN THE GAME
SO IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A USE (OR SO IT WOULD SEEM) THEN YOU ARE NOT
IN THE REGISTERED VERSION. IN THE REGISTERED VERSION AT HIGH SKILL LEVEL
THE "BLACKSMITH" CAN TAKE APART BARS AND DOOR HINGES/ THE "HUNTER" CAN
AVOID COMBAT BECAUSE HE SEES THE ENEMY FIRST!/ THE "ARCHITECT" CAN
TRAVEL THROUGH WALLS BY TAKING THEM APART AND PUTTING THEM BACK/ THE
"DISGUISE" CAN BE USED TO AVOID PASSWORD CHECKPOINTS/ IN ALL VERSIONS
OF THE GAME THE "LINGUIST" CAN READ FOREIGN LANGUAGES AT VARIOUS LEVELS
OF DIFFICULTY/ THE "RIDER" CAN RIDE THE MOUNTS OF THE WORLD DEPENDING
UPON THE MOUNT AND HIS/HER SKILL LEVEL. THE "TREKIE" CAN MOVE THROUGH
CERTAIN AREAS WHERE OTHER CANNOT BECAUSE OF FOLIAGE DENSITY OR TYPE
OF TERRAIN.

8. BE AWARE THAT SOME SPELLS CAN GET YOU CAUGHT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE MANY
OF THEM OR ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION. AMONG THESE SPELLS ARE "WATER WALKING"
AND "SHORT TUNNEL". BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THEM UNLESS YOU LIKE SPENDING
THE REST OF THE GAME STUCK IN A WALL OR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN.

9. THIS FILE WILL GIVE YOU NO HINTS. THESE ARE JUST THE BASICS BECAUSE
THE GAME HAS MANY HINTS WITHIN IT DEPENDING UPON HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO
SPEND ON SUCH THINGS YOU CAN GET SOME REALLY GOOD HINTS. OF COURSE, THIS
IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE SIMPLY ADVENTURING IS GOING TO GET YOU THROUGH
THE GAME AS FAST AS READING ALL THE HUNDRED HINTS OR SO.

10. THERE ARE NEARLY 100 MAPS. THIS FIGURE MIGHT BE ABOVE OR BELOW THE
ACTUAL NUMBER BECAUSE I AM STILL MAKING THEM BUT IF MY CALCULATIONS HOLD
UP THEN THERE MIGHT BE JUST OVER 100 MAPS. I ENJOY MAKING THEM LOOK UNIQUE
SO I OCCASSIONALLY POP A FEW HIDDEN ONES IN AS SURPRISES. BUT NEEDLESS TO
SAY THIS IS A REALLY HIGH NUMBER OF MAPS AND MAKES THE GAME REALLY VAST.

11. THERE ARE OVER 200 MONSTERS. IN FACT THERE ARE OVER 200 RIGHT NOW AND
I AM STILL ADDING SPECIAL ENCOUNTERS AND THE LORDS AND ENEMIES OF THE LANDS
SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE OVER 300 MONSTERS.

12. ALL OF THESE FEATURES INCLUDING THE 66 SPELLS, MISSILE AND RANGED
COMBAT AND MULTIPLE OPPONENTS AS WELL AS VARIOUS TREASURE TYPES WILL MAKE
THE EXPERIENCE OF PLAYING "THE EARTH LORDS" A VERY UNIQUE ONE. NO TWO
CHARACTERS WILL PROBABLY BE ALIKE AND NO TWO METHODS OF ADVENTURE WILL
LIKELY BE SIMILAR. ALL IN ALL I WOULD HOPE YOU AGREE THAT THIS GAME IS
VERY FUN, VERY CHALLENGING AND VERY UNIQUE.


 ************************************************************************
 ************************** T H E   G A M E *****************************
 ************************************************************************


	BELOW ARE JUST A FEW FEATURES WHICH I DECIDED TO WRITE AS A MEANS TO
SHOW THAT WHEN THEY ARE ALL BROUGHT TOGETHER THAT A VERY UNIQUE GAME IS
CREATED. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OTHER GAME HAS ALL OF THESE FEATURES.

1. PRIESTS MAY TURN UNDEAD, DEMONS AND DEVILS.

2. MANY MONSTERS HAVE SPECIAL ATTACKS WHERE THEY CAN CAST SPELLS, POISON,
PARALYZE, CHARM OR DRAIN YOU OF LEVELS.

3. CHARACTERS MAY GAIN EXTRA ATTACKS IN COMBAT BY LEVELS AND ALSO BY USE
OF MAGIC OR RINGS.

4. CHARACTERS MAY BE ONE OF 8 RACES, ONE OF 26 CLASSES INCLUDING MULTICLASS
COMBINATIONS AS WELL AS MALE AND FEMALE SPECIFIC CLASSES, ONE OF 18 
RELIGIONS, ONE OF 9 ALIGNMENTS, THEY MAY CHOOSE CHARACTER PICTURES FROM
A VERY WIDE SUPPLY.

5. PICTURES CAN BE TURNED OFF OR ON.

6. THERE ARE OVER 60 WEAPONS, OVER 20 PIECES OF ARMOR AND OVER 35 MAGICAL
ITEMS.

7. A PLAYER MAY DROP ITEMS FROM THEIR BACKPACK AND ALLOW OTHERS OR 
THEMSELVES TO PICK THEM UP LATER.

8. COMBAT MESSAGES MAY BE ALTERED FOR YOUR OWN READING SPEED.

9. DOORS MAY HAVE THEIR LOCKS PICKED, UNLOCKED THROUGH SPELLS OR JUST
BROKEN IN BY A STRONG ENOUGH CHARACTER.

10. THERE IS AN ENDLESS VARIETY OF ITEMS AND MESSAGES FOR THE TRAVEL
SCREEN TO MAKE THE CASTLE, DUNGEON OR CAVE LOOK MORE REAL AND BROUGHT
TO LIFE IN A UNIQUE MANNER.

11. CHARACTER'S WHO CAST SPELLS MAY PICK THEIR SPELLS FROM THEIR SPELLBOOKS
AND THEN REST TO RETAIN THE KNOWLEDGE FOR THEIR USE IN ADVENTURING.

12. THE CHARACTER MAY BUY A MOUNT TO NAME AND RIDE WHICH WILL GIVE THEM
BETTER MOVEMENT IN OUTDOOR COMBAT. AND DEPENDING UPON THE MOUNT THEY
BUY THEY MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO FLY OR TELEPORT OR EVEN ASTRAL TRAVEL.

13. CHARACTERS OF NONHUMAN RACE MAY BE MORE THAN ONE CLASS.

14. HUMANS MAY BE MONKS, KNIGHTS, GUIDES AND ANTIKNIGHTS.

15. THERE ARE 12 CLERGY MISSIONS TO KEEP YOU BUSY LOOKING FOR CLUES
AND INFORMATION.

16. THERE ARE 10 IMPOSSIBLE QUESTS WHICH WILLL REQUIRE QUITE A BIT
OF SKILL AND ADVENTURING ON THE PLAYER'S PART.

17. THERE ARE OVER 40 SPECIAL ENCOUNTERS JUST WAITING TO FIGHT YOU OR
GIVE YOU SPECIAL INFORMATION AS WELL AS A GREAT ITEM OR WEAPON.

18. THERE ARE 8 OTHER ASTRAL REALMS TO VISIT BESIDES THE EARTH REALM.
THESE PLACES ARE REALLY TOUGH TO SURVIVE IN BUT NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR
THE PLAYER TO BE AWARDED A SEAT IN THE HALL OF THE EARTH LORDS.

19. THIS GAME COMES AS CLOSE TO PLAYING A REAL CAMPAIGN WITH YOUR
FRIENDS AROUND A TABLE WITH DICE AND PAPER AS IT GETS ONLY I SUPPLY
THE DICE AND THE PAPER AND THE MONSTERS AND MAYHEM RIGHT HERE IN THE
GAME ON LINE.

20. THE DREADED ARENA ALLOWS YOU TO PRACTICE YOUR OWN CURRENT LEVEL OF
FIGHTING AGAINST OPPONENTS OF SIMILAR STRENGTH THOUGH SOME ARE TOUGHER
AND SOME ARE WEAKER. THIS WILL PREPARE YOU FOR THE WORLD YOU WILL SPEND
MOST OF YOUR TIME ADVENTURING THROUGH.

21. ONLINE HINTS CAN BE PURCHASED FOR A PRICE DEPENDING UPON WHICH LEVEL
OF HINTS YOU ARE BUYING. THEY GET MORE EXPENSIVE AS YOU BECOME ADDICTED
TO CHEATING AND WIMPING OUT ON YOUR FELLOW ADVENTURERS.

22. OLMS/MUFFLE AND WHOS WORK IN THE GAME SO IF YOU GET STUCK AND ANOTHER
PLAYER ONLINE CAN WALK YOU THROUGH THE DIFFICULT BITS THEN YOU MAY OLM
EACH OTHER. HITTING THE "5" KEY WILL REDRAW THE MAP.

23. PLENTY OF FUN AND UNSUSPECTED SURPRISES BUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
ALLOWS YOU AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF OPTIONS AS TO HOW YOU WILL GET AROUND
IN THIS LAND OF CHAOS AND ADVENTURE. GO THROUGH WALLS, TAKE THE LONG
WAY, TELEPORT THROUGH LEVELS OR JUST GO FOR THE GUSTO AND FIGHT, FIGHT,
FIGHT.

24. READ THE NEWS FROM DAY TO DAY AND CHECK OUT THE PROGRESS OF YOUR
COMPETITION AS FAR AS GAINING LEVELS OR WIMPING OUT AND BUYING HINTS FROM
THE GODS.

25. THIS GAME THRIVES ON EXPLORATION AND THERE ARE SO MANY RPG SURPRISES 
AND MISSIONS AND QUESTS THAT IT WILL NOT BECOME TEDIOUS LIKE SOME OTHER
ONLINE RPGS.

26. THERE ARE TRICKS, TRAPS, TELEPORT SQUARES, RIDDLES, TRAP DOORS,
GUARD POSTS, PASSWORDS, MAPS AND A FEW HUNDRED OTHER THINGS THAT WILL
MAKE YOU USE YOUR MIND AS WELL AS YOUR SWORD AS YOU TAKE ON THE EARTH'S
GREATEST NASTIES IN AN EFFORT TO BECOME AN EARTH LORD.

27. MENUS BECOME APPARENT WHEN YOU SELECT AN ACTION OR MOVE AROUND THE
OUTER WORLD SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HIT A BUNCH OF KEYS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO.

28. MOST ACTIONS ARE OPERATED THROUGH HOT KEYS SO HITTING ONE KEY WILL
ENABLE THE RESULT OR FUNCTION OR TO OCCUR.

29. SINCE THE FIRST PERSON TO DEFEAT ONE OF THE FOUR MAJOR ENEMIES OF
THE CITY STATE WILL BECOME AN EARTH LORD CAUSING THE GAME TO RESET THIS
GAME HAS BEEN PAINSTAKINGLY CREATED TO DISMANTLE CHEATING. NO MATTER HOW
MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE OR HOW MANY SPELLS OR SCROLLS OR WANDS OR POWERFUL
WEAPONS YOU OBTAIN YOUR ARMOR CLASS CANNOT GO LOWER THAN -10 AND ANY AND
EVERY MONSTER CAN HIT YOU ON A NATURAL ROLL OF 20 SO YOU CAN NEVER BE
INVINCIBLE AND ENEMY SPELLCASTERS OR SPECIAL ATTACKS CAN ALWAYS DO
DAMAGE TO YOU. THERE IS ALSO NO WAY TO RAISE A TRAIT LIKE AGILITY OR
MIGHT ABOVE 20 AND YOU CANNOT BUY HEALTH OR RAISE YOUR ABILITY TO HIT
OR DO DAMAGE OTHER THAN THROUGH THE ACT OF GAINING EXPERIENCE AND GAINING
LEVELS UNLIKE IN "BATTLE LANDS" WHICH DID NOT RESET AND WAS NOT A GAME
OF PLAYER SKILL VERSES PLAYER SKILL. YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO EXPLORE THE
MAPS AND VISIT THE PROPER PEOPLE TO GET THROUGH THIS GAME SO THERE ARE
NO MAJOR CHEATS OR BACKDOORS.

30. AND MANY OTHER UNIQUE FEATURES YOU WILL FIND THAT WILL MAKE THIS
GAME ONE OF THE BEST ONLINE ROLE PLAYING GAMES YOU HAVE EVER PLAYED
I HOPE. I HOPE IT IS ADDICTIVE AND DIVERSE. I STRIVED TO MAKE IT UNIQUE
AND DIFFERENT AND HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL SINCE "BATTLE LANDS". I ALSO
MADE THIS GAME IN SUCH A WAY THAT ADDITONAL CAMPAIGNS AND CODE CAN EASILY
BE ADDED TO BRING IN A MUCH LARGER WORLD. THERE IS REALLY NO END TO
WHAT I CAN ADD WITH THE SPECIAL CONSTRUCTION SET I CREATED. SO EVEN IF
THIS IS THE REGISTERED VERSION DO NOT EXPECT THAT IT WILL NECESSARILY END
HERE. LOOK FOR OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN PACKS TO BE RELEASED AT REALLY REASONABLE
PRICES NEAR THE END OF 1994 IF MY SCHEDULE STAYS IN EFFECT. CODE UPDATES
TO REGISTERED USERS WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE FOR FREE BUT THESE DUNGEON
AND CAMPAIGN PACKS MIGHT COST 5 BUCKS A PACK (WITH NOT LESS THAN 30 NEW
MAPS) OR 3 PACKS FOR 10 BUCKS IF I MAKE AS MANY AS THERE IS A DEMAND
FOR. THESE PACKS WILL INCLUDE NEW MISSIONS AND QUESTS AS WELL AS ALL THE
MAPS AND CODES SO ALL THAT THE SYSOP WOULD NEED TO DO WOULD BE TO PLACE
EVERYTHING IN ITS PROPER LOCATION AND THE WORLD WILL GROW THAT MUCH
LARGER.

									OF
							" THE EARTH LORDS"

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QUESTION: WHAT DO I GET IN THE REGISTERED VERSION?

ANSWER: THE REGISTERED VERSION IS WINNABLE. IT CONTAINS EVERYTHING YOU READ
ABOVE WHICH IS NEARLY 100 MAPS (ABOVE OR BELOW), 300 MONSTERS, 12 MISSIONS,
10 IMPOSSIBLE QUESTS, THE MAIN GOAL HAS BEEN PUT BACK IN AS WELL AS ALL THE
30 FEATURES AND OTHERS I COULD NOT THINK OF LISTED ABOVE. THE UNREGISTERED
VERSION ONLY HAS 3 MISSIONS, 1 QUEST, 30 MAPS, 200 MONSTERS AND IS NOT 
WINNABLE. THE REGISTERED VERSION IS ALSO CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING THE EXTRA
PLUG-IN CAMPAIGNS AND MISSIONS WITH NO EXTRA EFFORT FROM YOU. YOU JUST
UNRACHIVE THEM TO PFILES AND THEY HAVE MAGICALLY BEEN ADDED. THE 
UNREGISTERED VERSION SIMPLY IGNORES THEM.

QUESTION: WHEN IS THE REGISTERED VERSION GOING TO BE AVAILABLE?

ANSWER: I AM LOOKING AT MAY 1ST, 1994. I TRY TO GIVE MYSELF AS MUCH TIME
AS POSSIBLE AND ALL I HAVE LEFT IS THE MAPS AND CODE. THE REST OF THE GAME
IS COMPLETE SO JUST KEEP CONTACTING THE HEADQUARTERS BBS FOR UPDATES BUT
DO NOT SEND ANY MONEY FOR MAILED REGISTRATIONS BEFORE MAY 1ST, 1994.

QUESTION: HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO REGISTER THE REGULAR REGISTERED VERSION?

ANSWER: SINCE THIS GAME WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO PLAY, IT TOOK ME MANY MONTHS
TO CREATE AND IT HAS OVER 2000 SEPARATE FILES AND IS NEARLY A MEG IN SIZE
THE REGULAR REGISTERED VERSION WILL ONLY COST $20.00 DOLLARS TO REGISTER
IF YOU INTEND TO DOWNLOAD IT FROM THE HEADQUARTERS BBS. IF YOU WANT IT
MAILED THEN IT WILL COST $25.00.

QUESTION: WHY THE EXTRA $5.00 TO MAIL OUT REGISTERED VERSIONS?

ANSWER: I KNOW THAT THE DISKS (2) AND MAIL CHARGES DO NOT TOTAL MORE THAN
$2.00 (OR RIGHT AROUND THERE) BUT THOSE WHO REQUEST THE MAIL OPTION (AND
THEY WILL OF COURSE BE GIVEN ACCESS TO DOWNLOAD FROM THE BBS AS WELL) WILL
ALSO BE GIVEN A NICE PRINTED (BUT STAPLED) DOCUMENT WHICH SHOWS THE MAIN
MAP SETUP AND TELLS ALL THE MAIN ENEMIES, MISSIONS AND QUESTS AND LISTS
THE HINTS AS THE PLAYER CAN BUY THEM. IT PRINTED WITH TWO COLUMNS AND SMALL
FONTS BUT IS STILL ABOUT 10 PAGES IN LENGTH AND VERY FULL OF INFORMATION.

QUESTION: YOU SAY REGULAR REGISTERED VERSION. IS THERE ANOTHER?

ANSWER: YES. I AM GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO REGISTER MY PERSONAL MAIN
CODE WHICH I USE TO CONSTRUCT THE MAPS AND MAP CODE. THIS CODE HAS A
"BUILD" FEATURE WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO (AFTER YOU HAVE DRAWN A MAP WITH
AN ANSI EDITOR) TO MOVE ABOUT YOUR MAP AND ADD ANY FEATURE YOU WISH
INTO THE READABLE CODE LIKE SPECIAL ENCOUNTERS, TEXT SQUARES, SKILL
SQUARES, TELEPORT SQUARES, MOUNTAINS, OCEANS, ENTRANCES TO OTHER MAPS,
RIDDLE SQUARES AND ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU LAND ON, BUMP
INTO OR ENCOUNTER ON ANY MAP I HAVE CREATED BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I
USE TO CREATE MY MAPS AND CAMPAUGNS AND QUESTS AND ENTIRE WORLD FOR
THAT MATTER. THIS ALSO INCLUDES THE WEAPON, ARMOR, SPELL, MONSTER
AND ITEM MAKER SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORLDS
LIKE FUTURISTIC WORLDS OR WHATEVER. THESE PLACES YOU BUILD, HOWEVER,
CAN ONLY BE USED ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT WORK
WITHOUT MY REGISTERED "THE EARTH LORDS" CODE AND YOU CANNOT GO
GIVING THAT AWAY OR SELLING IT WITHOUT BREAKING COPYRIGHT LAWS. IN
BUYING THIS VERSION YOU WILL RECIEVE ANY REGULAR REGISTERED FILE AND
UPDATE AS WELL AS ACCESS TO THE GRAND TRADING BARN EVERYTIME YOU
MAKE A PACK TO SEND ME.

QUESTION: GRAND TRADING BARN? WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT?

ANSWER: HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A WORLD THAT GROWS ENDLESSLY AND IS TOTALLY
FREE OF CASH TO RECIEVE? WELL, IF YOU BUY THE DELUXE REGISTERED VERSION
OF "THE EARTH LORDS" AND MAKE A DUNGEON PACK WITH A MINIMUM OF 5 LEVELS
THEN YOU WILL RECIEVE A SIMILAR PACK MADE BY ME OR ANOTHER REGISTERED
USER SUCH AS YOURSELF FOR FREE.

QUESTION: SOUNDS COOL BUT HOW DOES THAT WORK?

ANSWER: THE DELUXE REGISTERED VERSION TELLS YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE
ON THE MAIN MAPS IN ORDER TO CREATE A NEW DUNGEON PACK WHICH WILL ALLOW
YOU ACCESS TO DOWNLOAD FREE PACKS FROM A CHOSEN MAP AREA. TO PUT IT MORE
SIMPLY HERE IS WHAT YOU DO. TAKE ONE OF THE MAIN 12 EXTERIOR MAPS OR ONE
OF THE MAIN EXTERIOR MAPS FROM THE OTHER REALMS OUTSIDE THE REALM OF THE
EARTH (SUCH AS THE REALM OF DEATH ETC.) AND ADD A PLACE WHERE WE CAN SEE
YOUR DUNGEON, MAKE THE CODE TO ENTER YOUR DUNGEON AND ALL THE CODE FOR
YOUR DUNGEON'S INTERIOR (OR CASTLE OR WHATEVER) AS WELL AS ANY QUESTS OR
MISSIONS THAT BRING THE CHARACTERS TO THIS LOCATION AND ARCHIVE ALL THE
FILES ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE DELUXE EDITION PACKET AND UPLOAD
IT TO THE HEADQUARTERS BBS IN THE AREA DESIGNATED FOR YOUR UPLOADING OF 
SUCH PACKETS. GIVE IT AN ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION AND LEAVE ME EMAIL ON
WHAT MAP# OF THE AVAILABLE PACKETS YOU WANT ACCESS TO. I WILL THEN ADD
YOUR PACKET TO MY CAMPAIGN WORLD AND RUN A FEW TESTS FOR SAFETY SAKE AND
IF IT PASSES THE TESTS YOU WILL BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE AVAILABLE PACKET
DRAWER YOU WANTED REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY PACKETS EXIST INSIDE. I WILL ALWAYS
TRY TO PUT ALL PACKETS INTO A MANNER WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO SIMPLY DUMP
THEM INTO YOUR OWN GAME BUT REMEMBER THAT WITH PEOPLE CONSTANTLY MAKING
MAPS AND PACKETS YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO GO INTO YOUR OWN ANSI EDITOR
AND ADD THEIR PACKET CASTLE OR DUNGEON ENTRANCE TO YOUR CURRENT MAP AS
WELL AS THE CODE WHICH WILL ALLOW ENTRANCE TO THIS NEW ADDITION ONTO YOUR
EXISTING MAPCODE. EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE DELUXE
EDITIONS "ADDING PACKETS" TEXT FILE. I WILL ALSO (FOR THE DELUXE REGISTERED
VERSION ONLY) CONSTANTLY CHANGE THE CODE TO ACCOMODATE MORE EXTERIOR
MAP PACKETS AND ALLOW FOR ENCOUNTERS BY AREA TYPE.

QUESTION: THAT SOUNDS AWESOME! AN ENDLESSLY GROWING PFILE! I BET ITS 
	EXPENSIVE!

ANSWER: WRONG! THE ONLY FEATURE THAT MAKES IT A MAJOR DIFFERENCE FROM THE
REGULAR REGISTERED VERSION IS ITS ABILITY TO ADAPT AND ADD CODE TO EVER
CHANGING PACKETS. BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU A VIRTUALLY ENDLESS PFILE AS FAR
AS SIZE IT WILL COST $25.00 TO DOWNLOAD FROM THE BBS AND $30.00 IF YOU
WANT IT MAILED. IN-OTHER-WORDS, TO CHANGE "THE EARTH LORDS" REGISTERED
VERSION INTO AN EVER GROWING PFILE IT WILL ONLY COST 5 DOLLARS EXTRA. THEN
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE A CASTLE OR DUNGEON OF 5 COMPLETE LEVELS OR
MORE AND GAIN ACCESS TO THE MAP OF YOUR CHOICE. ANOTHER SUCH PACKET
ALLOWS YOU ACCESS TO ANOTHER SUCH MAP. THIS ENCOURAGES PARTICIPATION
AND EVENTUALLY YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE AVAILABLE MAPS.

QUESTION: IT SOUNDS GOOD BUT GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU MEAN.

ANSWER: IF YOU MAKE A 5 OR MORE LEVEL DUNGEON OR CASTLE WHICH HAS ALL
THE NECESSARY INGREDIENTS TO ADD TO "THE EARTH LORDS" CAMPAIGN WORLD
AND FUNCTIONS AS IT SHOULD THROUGH MY TESTING THEN YOU CAN SAY THAT YOU
WOULD LIKE ACCESS TO EXTERIOR MAP NUMBER 5. THAT MEANS THAT ANY PACKET
MADE TO BE ADDED TO EXTERIOR MAP NUMBER 5 CAN BE DOWNLOADED BY YOU
FOR FREE "NO MATTER HOW MANY PACKETS ARE ADDED".

QUESTION: WHAT IF I WANT SOME PACKETS BUT NOT THE DELUXE VERSION.

ANSWER: THE ONLY PACKETS FOR SALE ARE ONES WHICH I PERSONALLY CREATE.
THESE WILL BE $5.00 A PACKET AND ARE ONLY OFFERED AS DOWNLOADS AND NOT
MAIL OUTS. I WILL NOT SELL ANY PACKET UNLESS IT HAS AT LEAST 30 MAPS
IN IT AND NEVER SEND MONEY FOR A PACKET UNLESS YOU SEE A POSTING SAYING
IT IS AVAILABLE.

QUESTION: HOW DO I GET ALL THE NEAT PACKETS MADE BY OTHER USERS?

ANSWER: BUY THE DELUXE VERSION AND MAKE YOUR OWN TO TRADE AT THE GRAND
TRADING BARN. PACKET MAKERS CANNOT SELL THEIR WORKS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT
SELL "THE EARTH LORDS" CODE BECAUSE IT IS COPYRIGHTED AND WITHOUT IT
YOU CANNOT RUN PACKETS AND WITHOUT THE DELUXE VERSION YOU CANNOT ADD
PACKETS UNLESS SOMEONE HAS ADDED THEM TO THE MAIN MAPS FOR YOU.

QUESTION: ALL THIS SOUNDS AWESOME AND REVOLUTIONARY. I CAN MAKE MY OWN
	PACKETS AND HAVE THEM USED ON OTHER BBSES. WHERE DO I SEND THE
	REGISTRATION FEE FOR EITHER VERSION WHEN THE DAY ARRIVES THAT THEY
	ARE AVAILABLE?




ANSWER:
REGULAR REGISTRATION FEE: $20.00
DELUXE EDITION FEE: $25.00
SHIPPING & HANDLING (IF MAILED OUT ONLY): $5.00 - INCLUDES SPECIAL DOCS
