This is about the most configurable Last X Callers program there is in
existence for CNet Amiga!  All output is fully configurable.  Show only
the CNet variables/statistics that YOU want shown about the last callers.
Also, now logs network (FTS) calls.  Can be tricked into logging UseNet/
uucico/getty calls.
