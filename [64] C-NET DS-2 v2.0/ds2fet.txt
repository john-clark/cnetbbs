C-Net 64 DS2 BBS
Electronic Bulletin Board System


History

C-Net has been around about as long as the Commodore 64 computer.  Ken Pletzer
of Perspective Software was the original developer of all three platforms of
C-Net BBS program from the 64 to the Amiga versions.  Ken wrote the first 10
versions of C-Net 64 BBS, then went on to the Commodore 128, where he stuck it
out for about 4 versions of C-Net 128 BBS.  Ken also developed the C-Net Amiga
BBS program versions 1-4.  

After version 10 of C-Net 64 BBS, a few other programmers came into the picture. 
Jim Selleck, Ray Kelm and Don Gladden helped develop versions 11 and 12 which
kept Ken's basic concepts, but further developed the compatibility and
efficiency of the program.  Ray Kelm and Don Gladden who helped develop version
12, later used this version of C-Net to develop Image BBS while Jim Selleck went
off to develop the DS2 versions of C-Net, using ideas from all the previous
releases, as well as a few new techniques he found or developed on his own.

C-Net 64 DS2 v2.0 was the first DS2 named version of C-Net, while v1.0 was
actually named C-Net 64 v11.6a.  The DS2 stands for Developers System 2.  Jim
named it this because the BBS was written with the BBS developer in mind.  With
almost all text output in BASIC, making it easily modified and modular programs
that overlay or append to the current running program, adding additional
features or loading in a completely different area of the BBS.

Jim Selleck's last release was C-Net 64 DS2 v2.5.  This release added CMD HD and
RAMLink support to C-Net, taking advantage of the partition and sub directory
layout of these devices.  Jim began development of version 3.0, but had to
shelve the project due to personal commitments.  A Canadian programmer, named
Rob Muscedere, has taken over the project and has interesting additions to the
C-Net program that Jim had envisioned.  Features like auto-reformatting text
output that formats the text output to that of the user, (40 or 80 columns)
Swiftlink support for high speed modem access, ANSI color and graphics support
and a new modular overlay system, unique to C-Net 64 DS2 v3.0.

Features

C-Net 64 DS2 BBS has many features that make it one of the best bulletin board
systems available for the Commodore 64.  Each area of the BBS is a separate
BASIC program that can be edited by the system operator, just like editing any
other BASIC program.  This part of the text will cover each area and some of the
features.  I'll be using the current release of C-Net 64 DS2 v2.5 as the model
for each of these areas.

Well, thats prettty much a list of most of the areas and the features of each
one.  With the structure of C-Net, most system operators find it so easy to
modify or create their own programs, that there has been hundreds of mods,
online games and other programs written by the system operators themselves.  The
6 online multi-player games that come with the C-Net 64 DS2 BBS package is a
result of one such system operator.  Paul Van Doleweerd has allowed us to
compile six of his programs and make them available with the program package. 
Paul also offers his own p-file disk of the latest release of his games and mods
for C-Net, free of charge.  You only have to be a registered system operator and
send him a letter with your name and return address to receive the disk.

Online Games

Adventure - A cool multi-player game where the user can create thier own
character name, pick a race, class and set of attributes in order to begin the
adventure that awaits your hero.  Users can build up their strength, money and
weapons by exploring the 6 deadly levels and killing creatures, or by battling
other users on the same quest as you.  Nicely thought out game.

Conquest - A new twist on the famous Empire online games seen on many other
BBS's.  User must buy and sell wheat, build armies, colonies, castles and other
good stuff.  Has many new options, addition of wizards and other tactics, make
this one a pretty involved game.  Really cool if several users play this one.

Empire v4.1 - The classic Empire game we played for years.  This is an oldy but
goody, especially when four or five users realy get going.

Mountain - A trivia king of the mountain style game where the users answer
trivia questions to build mana and power.  A little different, but a pretty cool
game to play if you like trivia style games.

Murder Motel - This one is kinda funny.  Your a murderer going into this hotel
loaded with weapons and other murderers.  Your goal is to find two objects that
fit together to make a weapon and try to kill everyone else in the hotel. 
Sounds easy?  Well, just remember they are doing the same thing, you have to
find the other people in the hotel and some found remedies or protection against
certain weapons.  Really neat game, users love it. 

Star Warrior - A trade wars style game, but not quite so invloved.  You travel
between planets, avoiding black holes and other obsticles as you land on
different planets to buy and sell goods, upgrade your ship with weapons, sheilds
and engines.  Battle with other users, confront the galatic police, etc.. 
Another pretty cool game for the users.

There are also tons of single player games available on the C-Net support BBS
(Cygnus X-1) as well as other C-Net BBS's.  All ya have to do is ask.

DS2 Network

Although not an internal part of C-Net 64 DS2 BBS, this program comes with the
latest release as an add on package to the BBS.  This was done for two reasons. 
First, DS2 Network was developed by someone else as a shareware program that was
meant for release with v3.0.  When Jim sheleved v3.0, Gary O'Brien released it
as shareware for all C-Net 64 DS2 BBS owners.  The second reason was because we
wanted the system operator to decide whether or not they want to run the
Network.  If not, there was no need to install it and waste the memory.

As well as having the ability to connect with other C-Net 64 DS2 BBS's and share
like message bases, email and other areas of the BBS, DS2 Network is now
compatible with CommNet.  CommNet is a joint effort between Image, C-Net 128 and
C-Net 64 DS2 to connect with each other, creating a much larger network with
three times the Commodore support.

Here's a few features of DS2 Network:

NetMail 		- Send email to any user on any BBS in the Network.  

NetSubs 		- Select 0 to 20 subboards to become Networked Subs

NetWall		- Graphiti Wall shared between Image and C-Net 64 DS2

NetClassifieds	- Lists articles to trade or sell in specific categories or
email someone who's selling or trading.

NetMatchmaker	- Fill out an application or search for others with your
interests to send email to.

NetNodes		- List of BBS's in the Network.  List with any
attribute, name, home node, phone number,etc..

NetCharges		- Not actually used, but keeps a running total of money
owed for sending netmail for each user

NetActivity		- Keeps a monthly total and percentage of all Network
traffic on your BBS.

NetLogs		- Keeps track of activity in the network, incoming and outgoing 				  
calls to your home node on a monthly basis.  Outgoing call logs keep running 
total of time online.

NetAuto-Maint	- Automatically weeds old messages in the message base, 				  
Netwall and NetClassifieds according to the number of days you 	set it for
	
DS2 Network is written to run automatically after the system operator configures
all the options.  It can be configured to call out on specific days of the week
or manually when the system operator can be there to watch it.  The system
updates the node list, networked subboard list and configured options
automatically to every system in the network.  Only one call is made to both
send and receive information.  The BBS that joins the network calls their Home
Node and sends a packet, then receives a packet.  The system then disconnects
and sorts the material.

Any BBS can be both a remote and a home node to other BBS's.  Each BBS can
configure their system to be as large or small as they like.  You can run a
NetMail only system, which means the only network traffic you'll get is NetMail
and updates, or you can run any combination of subboards, wall, classifieds,
matchmaker etc.  This control allows the system operator to control the size of
the packets they receive as well as the amount they spend each month on long
distance costs for the network, if any.  If your Home Node is local, of course
there are no LD costs.

The network program that comes with C-Net 64 DS2 BBS is in its unregistered
form.  The main difference between the unregistered and registered version is
that the registered version has the ability to send program updates, has a Net
Maps option and color menus.  Registration is $15.00 and comes with the
registered version of the program and a programmer reference guide for the
network.
