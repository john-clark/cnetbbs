<h3>Introduction:</h3><p>

C-Net, along with All American and Color 64, round out the old "BIG 3" of
the BBS programs from the early Commodore BBS hey-day.  C-Net, however,
deserves considerable special mention as being, in my opinion, one of the
finer programs on the market through it all.<p>

At the center of C-Net's superiority is not its style, or its familiarity,
or how pleasing it was to work with-- as it was definitely none of these.
C-Net is _powerfull_.  Mr. Pletzer stayed well ahead of the pack to the
end providing unheard of SysOp support, flexibility, programmability,
stability, and just a whole slew of options.  It was never a program to
run on a single 1541 drive, and with good reason, it does too much.<p>

C-Net, although not stylish, is certainly unique.  It is built apon a
highly modular framework, modular in code as well as menu structure.  The
modules are small overlays whose constant loading when the user navigates
the system is hardly noticed.  This was an obvious pull away from the
popular style of its peers, having most options on a single main menu with
very few special functions at menus of their own.  C-Net did not sacrifice
quick access by the user through this, however, as all the often needed
options are available from all menus.<p>

Another little trick C-Net pioneered are its "MCI" codes, or special
character codes which may be entered into any message (if access is allowed)
which then, when interpreted by C-Net's message reader, are interpreted to
display current user information, change colors, or perform special functions.
This allowed messages, if properly done, to double as primitive script files.<p>

C-Net was originally the work of Jim Selleck and Ken Pletzer, who also wrote
the 128 version.<p>

<h3>The Facts:</h3><p>

The information below applies to C-Net 11.1, which is the last version I
had access to.  The mention of network support comes at best from rumor
and recalled observations, the details are unknown (and thus wanted!)
