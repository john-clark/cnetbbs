C-Net 12.0 was not based on C-Net 11.0/11.1a but was based primarily on C-Net 10.0 written by Ken Pletzer. 

It was based on C-Net 10.0 written by Ken Pletzer and was coded by Don Gladden and Ray Kelm.   It originally sold for $64.95 or a upgrade from V10 or V11 for $35.00.

During the summer of 1988, version 12.1 (also written by Don Gladden) was set to be released as a $7.98 upgrade. During this time Don Gladden left Perspective Software and took 12.1 with him. After a few changes, it was rebranded as Image BBS 1.0. The C-Net Sysop Support Center (CSSC) was replaced with NISSA (The New Image Sysop Support Association). 

C-Net 12.1 would eventually be released by Perspective Software.
