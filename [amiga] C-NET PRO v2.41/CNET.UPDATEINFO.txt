--NEW FEATURES--
Following is a list of new features added since the publication of the
original spiral bound 2.0 manual:

NOTE:	References to manual PAGE NUMBERS in the early parts of this file
	are to the OLD spiral bound manual and will not apply to the revised
	binder edition.  However, the new manual has been changed to reflect
	those new features.  Changes beyond 2.20 will refer to page numbers
	in the NEW manual in the binder.


--- version 2.31  26-September-1992

109.	The BBSLIST program was updated to include SEARCH ability.  Users
	can select up to 5 keywords to search for in systems' names,
	nations, locations or descriptions.  CNet will find a match if
	any one of the keywords match for each search item for which
	keywords were entered.

110.	The AREXX interface received many new commands.  Following is
	a run-down:

	CALLEDITOR {s}		This invokes the user's default editor.
				The current contents of the editor's
				buffer are loaded, and the results are
				re-saved.  "1" is returned if the temp
				buffer is not empty ("0" otherwise).

	CHANGEWHAT {s}		Set the user's COMMAND field in WHO
				displays and the control panel.  This
				feature may not yet be implemented.
				The command is added for upward
				compatibility.

	CHANGEWHERE {s}		Set the user's ACTION field in WHO
				displays and the control panel.

	CLEAREDITOR		Clears the contents of the editor temp
				file.  Use this before STARTEDITOR if
				you do not use LOADEDITOR.

	CLOSEDISPLAY		Close the port screen or workbench window.

	FEEDBACK		This performs the standard FEEDBACK
				command, allowing the user to leave a
				message to the sysops.

	FINDACCOUNT {s}		This function accepts either an account
				number of a handle.  It performs the
				familiar handle-search if necessary.  The
				account number is returned if there is
				no problem.  0 is returned otherwise.

	GETSCRATCH {s}		Operates like GETUSER, but reads user
				data from the internal "scratch" account
				structure.  With LOADSCRATCH, this is
				useful for examining user's accounts
				other than the current user's.

	LOADEDITOR {s}		This will read the filename given by
				{s} into the editor temp buffer.

	LOADSCRATCH {s}		This command should be performed before
				GETSCRATCH's.  The argument must be a
				valid account number.  RESULT will carry a
				"1" if everything was loaded OK, "0"
				otherwise.

	OPENDISPLAY		Attempt to open the port's screen or
				workbench window.  It may take a few
				seconds for the display to open.

	SAVEEDITOR {s}		Write the contents of the editor temp
				buffer to the file specified by {s}.
				If the file {s} already exists, it will
				be overwritten. RESULT will carry a "1" if
				everything was written OK, "0" otherwise.

	SETMAILSUBJ {s}		This command should be performed before
				EACH WRITEMAIL in order to set the SUBJECT
				of the mail about to be sent.

	SETMINFREE {s}		This command tells CNet when to STOP an
				upload-in-progress due to critical disk
				space.  {s} should be the lowest free-
				BYTES on the hard drive.

	SETPROTOCOL {s}		This command should be used before an
				XUP or XDN.  {s} should be a SINGLE
				character, matching a character in BBSPROTO
				to designate a specific protocol.  If you
				wish to allow the user to choose his own
				protocol, send {s} as a NULL string.

	XDN {s}			This command has been CHANGED so that it
				now performs an XPR file download of the
				specified file {s}.  The command SETPROTOCOL
				must be used first.

	XUP {s}			This command has also changed with XDOWN
				in the same way.  If the transfer is a
				batch protocol, it is OK to simply pass
				the PATH here.

	WRITEMAIL {s}		Write the contents of the editor temp
				buffer to the user's mailbox specified
				by {s}.  {s} must be a valid account
				number.  RESULT will carry a "1" if
				everything was sent OK, "0" otherwise.

111.	The C program interface received XPR upload/download function
	callbacks, operating identically to the AREXX counterparts.
	Please consult the PROGRAMMING directory on disk 2 for details.

112.	Several new BBSEVENT commands were added.  They are as follows:

	command	  arguments     description
	-------   ---------	-----------
	SYSOPIN   0 or 1	This command, together with the next
				three, control the pull-down menu
				settings available from the CONTROL
				panel.

				This one controls whether or not the
				system operator is avaiable for chat (C).

	NONEW	  0 or 1	Whether or not to accept new users (NEW).

	NOUD	  0 or 1	Whether or not to allow users into
				the upload/download base (U).

	NOPFILES  0 or 1	Whether or not to allow users into
				the pfiles base (P).

	RUND	  {path}	To complete the set of RUN commands, RUND
				is added to the existing RUNA and RUNC.
				RUND will execute a DOS program, channeling
				I/O to the current port.

				It is OK to include arguments for the file
				following the filename.

113.	If a user was reading his mail, and the system went down unexpectedly,
	previous versions of CNet would LOSE the entire mail file being read.

	This version will first check to see if a mail-read temp file exists
	before reading from the regular mail file.

114.	The NewScan at logon has been changed to more fully separate searches
	for new files versus messages.

	The browse for new files will still quickly locate all files
	uploaded SINCE YOUR LAST CALL.

	The read/yank/browse/scan for new messages will find all new
	POSTS and RESPONSES (including responses to files) since last
	SUBBOARD VISIT.  This scan will NO LONGER locate "new files."
	This prevents the duplication of files problem, and will make it
	easier for sysops to maintain more separate FILES versus MESSAGE
	areas.

	As a bonus, if you are using a QWK mail reader, CNet WILL assemble
	the list of new uploads into the QWK file "newfiles.dat" which
	some readers will allow you to read.

	The standard YANK and YG commands (from subboard prompts) will
	still pull files as well as messages.

115.	For QWK bundling, CNet will recognize two new files, SYSTEXT:qwkstart
	and SYSTEXT:qwkend, which will be bundled with a QWK packet to be
	read to the user as the HELLO and GOODBYE files.

--- version 2.35  3 October 1992

116.	Paragon/Xenolink door support.  If you have any C "doors" from these
	programs, CNet is now able to interpret them.  When adding a pfile
	to a Pfiles list, select X as its type.

117.	The Z and ZG search commands have been moved to an external program
	(actually, they now use YANK-TASK).  This removes the long delays
	the user once had to endure while waiting for the system to
	search possibly thousands of messages.  Just as when yanking
	messages, the system will OLM the user when the search is complete.

	Yank-task will "mark" matching messages.  A new command "RM" was
	added to allow users to read their marked messages.

	In addition to "keywords" for a search, users may specify "filters."
	Filters are words/phrases that PREVENT a message from being marked.

	The Z command remains at the "respond or pass" prompt, working
	just as it had before.  This allows users to quickly search THAT ONE
	POST using the old method.

118.	CNet now maintains a new format for the old "bbs.alpha" (alpha
	ordering of users by handle).  Now, this primary key information
	is actually sotred in MEMORY (as it should be), and handle searches
	are now BLITZ fast.  No more waiting several seconds on large systems
	just to have the system tell you an account you are mailing is not
	there.

	You must set the maximum number of user accounts possible from
	the BBSCONFIG file.  In the past, CNet was internally limited to
	2000 accounts.  This limit has been lifted, and now CNet allows
	more than 32000 accounts.

	Use the new "pointers" C pfile to create the new file "bbs.ukeys."
	You may then delete bbs.alpha, as it will no longer be used.

	Plans exist for adding other keys to this file ... possibly real
	name, and data phone number.  This would allow FAST ifido operation,
	and FAST checks for use of duplicate phone numbers.

119.	The "Set keywords/filters/subboards?" prompt from the NewScan at
	logon's Yank option is now complete!  After you select Yank from
	the NewScan prompt, answering YES to the above question will take
	you to ANOTHER prompt, allowing you to set keywords/filters
	(which operate the SAME as when doing a global search), to set
	which subboards these keywords/filters will be used on, and to
	set which subboards will actually be yanked.

	A menu "sys.menu.yank" exists for this prompt, and there are
	additions to BBSMENU.

120.	Additional AREXX commands, to conform to ABBEREXX standard.

	BBSIDENTIFY {arg}

		{arg}		  returns
		ABBEREXX	: "1.0"
		BBS		: "2.35" or current CNet version
		EMULATION	: "ASCII" or  "ANSI"
		NAME		: Your BBS's name   (bbstext line 9)
		SYSOP		: Sysop's name	    (bbstext line 10)
		TERM		: <baud> <columns> <rows> <line>
		USER		: "<username>" "<callingfrom>" <access>
				  <access> is returned as GUEST for
				  new users, MEMBER for other users,
				  SYSOP for account #1, CO-SYSOP for
				  any other account with maintenance
				  access.

	CHECKABORT
		Returns 1 if user has pressed Control-C or SPACEBAR,
		0 otherwise.  You should call this AFTER a line of
		output has occurred.  Each time something is printed,
		this is reset.

	CLS
		Sends the screen-clear code.

	GETCHAR
		Already supported by CNet.

	HANGUP
		Same as CNet's DROPCARRIER

	IREADY
		Same as CNet's CHECKIO.

	MAYGETCHAR
		Returns the waiting-input character, or "NOCHAR" if the
		input buffer is empty.

	NEWLINE
		Sends the newline code.

	PRINT {arg}
		Same as CNet's TRANSMIT.

	PROMPT <length> {arg} '"<prompt>"'
		<length> is the maximum number of characters to input.
		{arg}	 is one of:
			NORMAL
			HIDE		: password input
			YESNO		: Yes/No, Yes is default
			NOYES		: Yes/No, No  is default
		<prompt> must be surrounded by double quotes, and then
		single quotes, so that AREXX will actually send the quotes
		to CNet.

	SEND {arg}
		Sends the given string without translation of any kind.
		(no MCI, etc).

	SENDFILE {arg}
		Same as CNet's SENDFILE.

	SETNODELOATION {arg}
		Same as CNet's NEW command CHANGEWHERE.

	SYSOPLOG {arg}
		Samge as CNet's LOGENTRY.

	The ABBEREXX standard supports three variables, TIMEONLINE, CARRIER,
	and TIMELEFT.  At this time, I have not located the correct
	procedure for adding external variables to an AREXX command file.

121.	When adding a subboard (AL), an option is given to copy the defaults
	from any other physical subboard number.  To aid this, physical
	subboard numbers are displayed during EL.

122.	FidoNet I/O may be directed to any logical device now (was
	hard-wired to MAIL: in the past).  The "net path" is editable
	from the EL display.  Examples are

			MAIL:			/* the default */
			MAIL:FIDO/		/* for more organization */
			RAM:			/* if you have the ram */

	If you use RAM:, you should MAKEDIR the appropriate directories
	somewhere in your cnet-startup file.

--- version 2.36  7-October-1992

123.	Commenting the BADNAMES and BADNUMBERS files is now allowed. Begin
	any line with a semicolon (;).

124.	Amaint now SUMMARIZES subboard message kills.  This should shorten
	logs for people with a lot of activity.  IFIDO/XFIDO now summarize
	THEIR activity, which is placed in LOG.MAINT, no longer a
	separate file.

125.	When using the MOVE command in a subboard, option is now given to
	NOT remove the original (in effect, a COPY option to go along with
	MOVE).

126.	Using a BBSMENU entry "NSAL," the "scan for new" at logon is now
	performed AFTER the user's normal logon-macro.

127.	BBSCONFIG has been changed CONSIDERABLY to offer consolidation of
	many files.  The files BBSQWK and BBSFIDO no longer exist.  All of
	the necessary information is right in BBSCONFIG.  Also, each
	subboard's EL screen allows selection of a network from the
	BBSCONFIG file.

--- version 2.37  10-October-1992

128.	When using the DS command, it is possible to remove RANGES of
	files.  Also, files removed here will "re-appear" after the
	download is complete.  This allows downloading PORTIONS of the
	select buffer at a time!

129.	The EA command allows editing of several more user preferences.

130.	The Z and ZG commands allow you to mark messages, ADDING to your
	PREVIOUS marked list.  NOTE: Previous versions may have left a file
	"_marked0" in users' directories, causing problem with RM.
	This file be deleted after the first use of RM.

131.	It is possible to insert MCI into GFILES/PFILES descriptions.
	This should add to their flexibility!

--- version 2.38  10-October-1992

132.	Line 9 of BBSTEXT contains the default logon-MACRO for new users.
	By default, this will contain the NSAL (new scan at logon) command.
	This now allows users to select whether or not they even WANT the
	NSAL as part of their logon procedure, and if they do, whether to
	do it BEFORE or AFTER other macro commands.

	You may wish to leave NEWS for existing users stating that if they'd
	still like the automatic NSAL, they need to add this to their
	logon macros.

133.	The L! command in the pfiles/gfiles has been modified to display
	ALL known information about the list.

134.	This version features better organization of its text files.  Within
	the SYSTEXT: directory, there are now HELP, MENU, NEW, and VDE
	subdirectories.  SYSDATA: must contain one new subdirectory
	entitled LOG.

	Also, several files within SYSTEXT: have been renamed as follows
	(note that "passwords" has moved to sysdata:):

	Old name			New name
	-----------------------		-----------------
	systext:sys.conf.noises		systext:noises
	systext:sys.passwords		sysdata:passwords
	systext:sys.new user		systext:sys.nuser

135.	Better organization is in place for systems using multiple
	BBSTEXT/BBSMENU files.  When CNet attempts to display a file
	from the SYSTEXT: directory, the following search chain is
	followed until a file is found:

	ex#1:  systext:menu/main	ex#2:  systext:sys.start
	------------------------	------------------------
	systext:x1/menu/tt4.main	systext:x1/tt4.start
	systext:x1/menu/main		systext:x1/sys.start
	systext:menu/tt4.main		systext:tt4.start
	systext:menu/main		systext:sys.start

	There are three things to know:

	1.	CNet checks subdirectories "systext:xX" where X is the
		BBSMENU/BBSTEXT number.  If the appropriate file is
		not found, systext: is checked as normal.

		You may copy NONE, ANY, or ALL of the systext: directory
		into an xX subdirectory.  If a file is not found, CNet
		will search the standard systext: directory.

	2.	As with all previous versions, CNet will search for the
		"ttX." prefix in place of the "sys." prefix for alternate
		terminal types (ANSI, IBM, etc).  If the file doesn't
		HAVE "sys." as part of its title, CNet will still search
		for the "ttX." prefix file (tt4.menu and menu above).

	3.	It is possible to have alternate text files in other
		parts of the system, such as entry/exit files, or pfiles.
		Given a filename, CNet will search for an "xX" directory
		before searching for the actual filename.

	ex#3:  base0:games/data/sys.entry
	---------------------------------
	base0:games/data/x1/tt4.entry
	base0:games/data/x1/sys.entry
	base0:games/data/tt4.entry
	base0:games/data/sys.entry

136.	More good news for systems running multiple BBSMENU/BBSTEXT files.
	CNet now loads all BBEMENU/BBSTEXT files at load-time.  If you
	have more ports that you do text sets, this will save you a
	considerable amount of RAM.  When a user logs on, or switches
	text sets, there is no longer a pause as a new bbstext/bbsmenu is
	read from disk.

137.	More organization is in place for the pfiles/gfiles/news areas.
	Each of these areas, and each of the subdirectories you have in
	these areas must now contain a new subdirectory entitled "DATA".

	Into these new directories, you must rename the files _Items2,
	sys.entry, sys.exit, and _dirinfo (if they exist).

	Old name			New name
	----------------		------------------
	pfiles:_Items2			pfiles:data/_Items2
	pfiles:_dirinfo			pfiles:data/_dirinfo
	pfiles:_sys.exit		pfiles:data/sys.exit
	pfiles:_sys.start		pfiles:data/sys.start
	pfiles:maintenance/_Items2	pfiles:maintenance/data/_Items2
	...repeat for gfiles:, news:
	...their subdirectories also

138.	For BASE and UDBASE areas, "subdirectories" and "direct exhange"
	subboards now must their own subdirectory in the appropriate BASE0:
	or UDBASE0: partition.  Previously, ony "real" subboards needed
	to have unique directories.  Within these new directories will be
	placed the entry and exit files.

	For example, if you have a subdirectory called "Amiga subboards"
	(which might contain several subboards), and you have given it the
	unique dirname of "amiga" ...

	Old name			New name
	---------------------		------------------
	base0:sys.exit.amiga		base0:amiga/sys.exit
	base0:sys.entry.amiga		base0:amiga/sys.entry

	This also applies to the BASE and UDBASE subdirectories themselves..
	Their  unique dirname is always "main"...

	base0:sys.exit.main		base0:main/sys.exit
	base0:sys.entry.main		base0:main/sys.entry

	Because in previous versions, direct exchange subboards did not
	HAVE unique-dirnames set when they were created, you should use
	the EL command to give all direct exchange subboards a name.

--- version 2.40  25-October-1992

139.	System configuration is now performed by a new executable
	entitled "CONFIG".  The following files are now obsolete, and
	should be deleted: BBSED, BBSPROTO, BBSCONFIG, BBSARC.

	The following files have changed format, and should be deleted:
	BBSPORT#?, BBSEVENT#?.  For convenience in re-configuration, it
	might be wise to print these first.

	The file "bbsconfig3" is a default configuration in the new format.
	After copying this file to your CNET: area, you may then use
	CONFIG to make changes.

	When editing/adding archivers, you should leave lines BLANK if
	they are not used.  Do not use "-".

140.	This version REQUIRES DOS 2.04 (V37) or higher to operate
	properly.  Many changes will be made to CNet in the near future
	to take advantage of more of the V37 power.
