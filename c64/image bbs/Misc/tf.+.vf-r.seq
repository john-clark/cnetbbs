ÂOB HAS WORKEDVERY CLOSELY WITH ÌITTLE ÊOHN AND HASREALLY DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB WITH THE"+.ÖÆ".ÓOME OF THE NEW FEATURES INCLUDE"CANNED" MESSAGES AND SELECTIVEDELETION OF FEEDBACK, NEW USERFEEDBACK, ETC.  ×E'LL LOOK AT ALL OFTHE DIFFERENT COMMANDS.ÔHE FEATURE THAT SEEMS TO CAUSE THEMOST QUESTIONS IS THE "CANNED MESSAGE"FEATURE.  Á "CANNED MESSAGE" IS SIMPLYA PRE-WRITTEN MESSAGE OR "FORM LETTER"THAT YOU MAY WISH TO SEND TO A USER,MUCH LIKE THE "NEW USER WELCOME".ÆROM THE INITIAL ÖÆ: PROMPT SELECTINGÃ WILL BRING UP AN OPTION MENUCONSISTING OF Á/DD, Å/DIT, Ë/ILL,Ì/IST, OR Ó/END.  ÓELECTING THE ÁDDOPTION WILL ASK YOU FOR A TITLE FORTHE MESSAGE, THEN PUT YOU IN THEEDITOR TO WRITE YOUR MESSAGE.  ÙOURMESSAGE CAN BE AS BRIEF OR AS LONG ASYOU'D LIKE AND CAN CONTAIN ANY ÍÃÉ ORCOLOR JUST AS ANY MESSAGE ENTERED INTHE EDITOR.ÔHE ÅDIT OPTION WILL ASK×ÈÉÃÈ MESSAGE TO EDIT.  Á NUMERICINPUT IS REQUIRED.  ÉF YOU DON'TREMEMBER WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO EDITSIMPLY ENTERING THE ?  WILL BRING UP ALIST OF TITLES AND NUMBERS, ENTER THENUMBER OF THE MESSAGE YOU WISH TO EDITAND IT WILL BE LOADED INTO THE EDITORFOR WHATEVER EDITING YOU DESIRE.ÔHE ËILL OPTION WORKS THE SAME WAY,THE NUMBER OF THE MESSAGE YOU WANTKILLED.  ÂETTER BE SURE HERE AS THEREIS NO SAFETY CHECK, IF YOU SAY KILL,IT IS GONE.ÌIST DOES JUST THAT, IT WILL PROVIDE ALIST OF AVAILABLE "CANNED MESSAGES".ÙOU CAN HAVE UP TO 60 OF THEM IF YOUDESIRE.ÔHE FINAL OPTION IS ÓEND, WHICH SIMPLYASKS WHICH ONE TO SEND.  ÁGAIN, IF YOUDON'T KNOW A QUESTION MARK WILL BRINGUP THE LIST.  ÖERY NEAT.ÁNOTHER OPTION THAT HAS BEEN ADDED ATTHE ÖÆ: PROMPT IS THE ABILITY TOMAINTAIN THE ×ALLWRITER.  ÔHIS NEEDSVERY LITTLE EXPLANATION, IT SIMPLYALLOWS YOU TO DELETE, KEEP OR ADD TOTHE SAYINGS ON THE ×ALL.  ÔHERE WAS AMINOR "BUG" IN THIS FEATURE BUT WASQUICKLY FIXED.  ÕNFORTUNATELY IT DIDNOT GET IN THE NEWSLETTER LAST MONTHWITH THE REST OF THE "FIXES".  ÈERE ITIS.  ÃHANGE LINE 326 TO 327 AND ADD ANEW LINE 326:326 ON-(S>.)GOTO328:GOTO324ÃHANGE THE ÇÏÔÏ326 TO ÇÏÔÏ327 IN LINE325 AND REMOVE THE :IFS>.  FROM THEEND OF THE LINE.  ÔHAT SHOULD DO IT.×HEN READING ANY OF THE FEEDBACK, NEWUSER FEEDBACK, TELECHECK LOG OR ERRORLOG YOU HAVE SEVERAL OTHER OPTIONSAVAILABLE AS WELL, THEY ARE:ÁCCS/ÃAN/ÃÒED/ÄEL/ÖIEW/ÆWD/ÒSPD/ÎEXT/ÏVER/ÑUIT/ÎEW #.ÔHE ONES THAT ARE NEW OR CHANGED INCLUDE THE ÃAN/ÃÒED/ÄEL AND ÖIEW.  ÔHE OTHERSARE UNCHANGED, OR HAVE MINOR CHANGES.ÓELECTING Ã WILL GIVE YOU THE OPTIONOF SENDING THE USER ANY OF THE "CANNEDMESSAGES".  ÙOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE ONETHAT YOU WANT TO SEND TO PEOPLE THATCONTINUALLY HAVE TROUBLE WITH THETELECHECK OR YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE THATYOU SEND TO ANYONE THAT RUNS INTO ANERROR ON YOUR SYSTEM (THOUGH HE SHOULDHAVE GOTTEN ERROR MAIL).  ×HEN YOUSELECT Ã YOU WILL BE ASKED "WHICH ONE"AND A ?  WILL BRING UP THE LIST OFTHOSE YOU HAVE AVAILABLE.ÔHE ÃÒED IS VERY HANDY FOR GIVINGÃÒÅÄÉÔ.  É'M SURE YOU HAVE ALL HADOCCASION TO NEED TO RESTORE SOMECREDIT TO A USER FOR A BAD DOWNLOAD ORAS A REWARD FOR SOMETHING, NOW YOU CANDO IT FROM HERE, NO NEED TO GO INTO ÅÄJUST TO GIVE HIM CREDIT.ÔHE ÄEL IS ONE OF MY OWN FAVORITES.ÔHE USER THAT SIGNS ON WITH ANOBVIOUSLY FAKE ACCOUNT OR THE IRATEUSER THAT SAYS "JUST DELETE ME FROMYOUR SYSTEM IF É CAN'T....." WHATEVER.ÔHE Ä WORKS ×ÏÎÄÅÒÓ..AND REALLY FEELSÇÏÏÄ AFTERWARDS.  ÍAY NOT GET A LOT OFUSE BUT WHEN IT DOES IT IS WORTHHAVING.ÆINALLY THE ÖIEW.  ÐARTICULARLY GOODON SYSTEMS WHERE MORE THAN ONE PERSONMAY GIVE ACCESS.  ÙOU CAN ÖIEW THEPERSON'S ACCOUNT TO SEE WHAT HISSTATUS IS.  ÉF HE HAS BEEN GIVENACCESS OR IF HE WANTS SOME CREDIT ORWHATEVER, THE ÖIEW IS PARTICULARLYUSEFUL.ÉN ADDITION TO THESE GREAT FEATURESTHERE HAS ALSO BEEN ADDED THEÓELECTIVE DELETE OPTION SO YOU CANDELETE ALL OR ANY PART OF YOURFEEDBACK OR OTHER MESSAGES.  ×HENÄELETE IS SELECTED FROM THE ÖÆ: PROMPTYOU SELECT WHICH TO DELETE THEN HAVEAN OPTION OF SELECTIVE OR AUTO DELETE.ÁLL IN ALL THE ÖÆ IS NOW ABOUTANYTHING A BUSY SYSOP COULD WANT TOMAINTAIN HIS DAILY MESSAGE TRAFFICFROM HIS USERS.  ÔHIS IS REALLY ONE OFTHE BETTER "HIDDEN" FEATURES OF "1.2".×ELL DONE ÄR.  ÂOB.(Á LATE NOTE HERE, SOMEONE THAT JUSTCONVERTED TO ÉÍÁÇÅ FROM 12.0 SAID THATTHE "+.ÖÆ" WAS ONE OF THE BESTFEATURES HE HAD NOTICED SINCE HISCONVERSION.)(C) ÊANUARY 1990 ÆANDÆ ÐRODUCTSÐERMISSION TO REPRINT IS GRANTEDPROVIDED THE FILE IS PRINTED IN IT'SENTIRETY.
