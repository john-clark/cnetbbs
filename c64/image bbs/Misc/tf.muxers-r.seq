ÀERNAL DRIVE, A        MULTIPLEXER ALLOWS YOU TO CONNECT TWOOR MORE OTHER COMPUTERS (√64 OR √128)   TO YOUR ÃT.ÀERNAL!  (ŸOU CAN ACTUALLYCONNECT UP TO FOUR COMPUTERS TO YOUR    DRIVE WITH ONE MULTIPLEXER, AND UP TOFOUR MULTIPLEXERS MAY BE "CHAINED"      ALLOWING FOR A TOTAL OF 16 COMPUTERS TOONE DRIVE).  …F YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS AND THOUGHT IT MIGHT NOT BE WORTHWHILE, ORYOU COULDN'T AFFORD IT, LET'S EXPLORE   SOME OF THE BENEFITS.  ∆IRST, THEDIFFERENCE IN RUNNING A BOARD WITH OR   WITHOUT A "MUXER" IS SIMILAR TO THEDIFFERENCE IN HAVING A ÃT. ÀERNAL OR NOT HAVING ONE. œR IT IS SIMILAR TOUPGRADING TO 1200 BAUD FROM 300 BAUD.¬Y THAT … MEAN ONCE YOU HAVE MADE THOSE "UPGRADES", YOU LOOK BACK AND WONDERHOW YOU EVER GOT ALONG WITHOUT IT!  …T'S THE SAME FEELING WITH THE MULTIPLEXER!¡FTER YOU HAVE IT, YOU √¡ŒŒœ‘ IMAGINE   EVER RUNNING A BOARD WITHOUT ONE!‘HE "MUXER" ALLOWS Ÿœ’ TO USE YOUR OWN  HARD DRIVE AS WELL AS JUST HAVING ITFOR THE BOARD.  ‘HAT IS IMPORTANT.      ¡FTER ALL YOU SPENT ALL THAT MONEY FORA DRIVE LIKE THAT, YOU SHOULD GET SOME  USE OUT OF IT TOO.◊ITH THE SECOND COMPUTER SET TO USE A   DIFFERENT Ã’ YOU ARE ABLE TO USE THEDRIVE WHILE SOMEONE ELSE IS ON THE BOARD AT THE SAME TIME. ŒOW DON'T GET ITWRONG. ‘HERE ARE SOME MINOR LIMITATIONS.  …N FACT YOU SHOULD BE CAUTIONED OFONE VERY IMPORTANT POINT, Ÿœ’ Œ≈≈ƒ ‘œ ¬≈ ”’“≈ Ÿœ’ ¡“≈ Œœ‘ ◊“…‘…Œ« ‘œ ‘»≈ ”¡Õ≈Ã’ ‘»¡‘ ‘»≈ ¬¬” …” ◊“…‘…Œ« ‘œ. …F YOU DO YOU WILL END UP WITH SOME CORRUPTEDFILES ON THE DRIVE.  ¬UT IF YOU SET     ASIDE ONE Ã’ JUST FOR USE WITH YOURSECOND COMPUTER AND ARE SOMEWHAT        CAUTIOUS YOU WON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM.‘HE REAL ADVANTAGE TO USING A MUXER WITH THE SYSTEM IS THE FLEXIBILITY ITALLOWS.  ¡S A ”YSOP YOU CAN USE THE ¬¬” COMPUTER (ON-LINE IN LOCAL MODE) TO RUNA –LUS FILE AND USE THE SECOND COMPUTER TO MODIFY IT AND CHANGE IT.  ‘HEN YOUCAN TRY IT AGAIN ON THE ¬¬” COMPUTER    WITHOUT EVER EVEN HAVING TO LOG-OFF. …TWORKS OUT GREAT AS A METHOD OF FIXING   BUGS AND/OR MODIFYING FILES. …T ALSOCOMES IN HANDY IN GENERAL UP-KEEP OF THE SYSTEM.  ◊ITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE DOWNTHE BOARD YOU ARE ABLE TO USE ANY OF THE ÃT.ÀERNAL FEATURES.  ŸOU CAN AUTOCOPYFILES FROM ONE Ã’ TO ANOTHER, BACK-UP   FILES, LOAD AND MODIFY PROGRAMS, TRYOUT UPLOADS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN VALIDATED YET, AND THE LIST GOES ON.…T IS SO WONDERFUL YOU WILL WONDER HOW  YOU EVER GOT ALONG WITHOUT IT.  …T ISALSO POSSIBLE TO ¬œœ‘ THE BOARD ON THE  SECOND COMPUTER, AND A FEW DARING SOULSHAVE EVEN ATTEMPTED TO RUN MORE THAN    ONE ¬¬” AT ONCE.  …T IS Œœ‘ RECOMMENDEDAS A USE FOR THE MULTIPLEXER.  …T'S VERY USEFUL TO HAVE THE ABILITY, HOWEVER,SINCE YOU CAN BOOT YOUR "BOARD" ON YOUR SECOND COMPUTER AND WORK ON PLUS FILESOR OTHER MODIFICATIONS WITHOUT ANY      DISRUPTION ON YOUR ¬¬”.  ÷ERY HANDY FOR"MODS" AND EVEN ROUTINE MAINTENANCE,    LIKE VALIDATING FILES, ETC. ¡LWAYS BEAWARE OF WHAT THE "MAIN" COMPUTER IS    DOING THOUGH. √OST WISE IS NOT TOO BAD EITHER.  ŸOU   WILL NEED THE MULTIPLEXER AND ANOTHERHOST ADAPTOR FOR THE SECOND COMPUTER.   ¡LL-IN-ALL IT WILL RUN ABOUT $200.  ŒOTBAD WHEN YOU CONSIDER IT IS ALMOST LIKE HAVING ANOTHER HARD DRIVE FOR YOURSECOND COMPUTER.  «RANTED IT IS NOT     ADDITIONAL DISK STORAGE ¬’‘ IT DOESALLOW THE GREATEST FLEXIBILITY AND      CONVENIENCE.  …T MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCEIN RUNNING AN EFFICIENT BOARD.  …T MAKES THE DUTIES OF BEING A ”YSOP MUCHEASIER. …T ALLOWS YOUR BOARD TO ACTUALLY BE ON-LINE FOR YOUR CALLERS MUCH MOREOFTEN.
