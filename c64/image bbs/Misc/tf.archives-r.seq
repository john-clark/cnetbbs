"ултимате лынь3" WILL UNлынь мост VERSIONS OF лыньUP TO лынььж.  "омега-я 2" WILL UNлыньмост VERSIONS OF лынь AS WELL AS MOSTOTHER ARCHIVAL PROGRAMS.  тO MAKE Aлынь FILE и'D SUGGEST USING лынь 17.аLL 3 PROGRAMS ARE MENU-DRIVEN ANDNEED NO MANUAL.тHERE IS ALSO A SELF DISSOLVING лыньTHAT IS IDENTIFIED BY THE ".SDL" ATTHE END OF THE PROGRAM NAME.  тHESEFILES CAN BE DISSOLVED BY LOADING THEMAS A BASIC FILE, TYPING рун, ANDSITTING BACK AND WATCHING THE FILEDISSOLVE.арц AND сда WILL NOT ONLY COMBINE THEFILES INTO A SINGLE FILE BUT WILL ALSOCOMPRESS THEM SO THEY TAKE UP LESSROOM THAN THEY NORMALLY WOULD.  тHEMAJOR DRAW-BACK IS THAT арц IS VERYHARD TO USE EVEN витх A MANUAL.  арцFILES ALL HAVE A ".ARC" AT THE END OFTHE PROGRAM NAME AND CAN BE UN-арцEDWITH EITHER арц OR омега-я.  тHELATEST VERSION и HAVE SEEN OF арц ISARC 2.50 AND THIS IS COMPATIBLE WITHALL EARLIER VERSIONS.  сда FILES MAYOR MAY NOT HAVE AN ".SDA" AT THE ENDOF THEIR PROGRAM NAME BUT THEY AREMUCH EASIER TO DISSOLVE.  ыOU SIMPLYLOAD THEM AS A NORMAL BASIC FILE, TYPEрун, AND A TITLE SCREEN APPEARS.  ыOUTHEN HIT ANY KEY TO START WRITING THENEW FILES OR HIT рун/стоп TO ABORT.иT IS BEST TO USE A NEW, FORMATTEDDISK WHEN DISSOLVING сда FILES SINCETHE NEW FILES MAY TOTAL маны MOREBLOCKS THAN THE ORIGINAL сда FILE.аркиже IS SIMILAR TO лынь AND HAS AN".ARK" AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM NAME.ыOU CAN USE EITHER аркиже ж2, ултимателынь OR омега-я TO DISSOLVE THE FILES.либрары IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST ANDLEAST-USED ARCHIVE TECHNIQUES.  тHESEFILES HAVE A ".LBR" AT THE END OFTHEIR PROGRAM NAMES AND YOU NEED TOUSE либрары TO DISSOLVE THESE FILESWHICH, LIKE лынь, MAY BE SAVED ASEITHER сея OR прг FILES.  тHE LATESTVERSION IS "либрары 9" AND ISCOMPATIBLE WITH ALL EARLIER VERSIONS.фINALLY FOR THOSE TROUBLESOME PROGRAMSTHAT MUST HAVE THE FILES LOCATED IN APARTICULAR PLACE ON THE DISK THERE'Sзип-цоде OR THE TWO FILES зип ANDунзип.  тHIS PROGRAM EXAMINES THE DISKIN FOUR PASSES AND ATTEMPTS TOCOMPRESS THE DATA THEN SAVES IT ASFOUR FILES THAT BEGIN WITH "1!", "2!","3!", AND "4!", FOLLOWED BY AFILENAME.  иF THERE IS A LOT OF DATAON THE DISK IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THATTHE FOUR FILES WILL TOTAL MORE THAN664 BLOCKS AND WILL HAVE TO BE SAVEDON TWO DISKS.  тHE унзип PORTION OFзип-цоде OR THE FILE унзип REVERSESTHE PROCESS AND WILL READ THE FOURFILES, UN-COMPRESS AND WRITE THE DATABACK TO A NEW DISK.  ыOU SHOULD ALWAYSFORMAT THE DISK WITH зип-цоде OR унзипAT THE PROMPT USING EITHER фаст форматOR нормал.тHE LATEST VERSION OF ALL THREEPROGRAMS IS VERSION 2 WHICH CORRECTEDTHE фаст формат BUG IN THE FIRSTVERSION AS WELL AS ADDED SOME NICEENHANCEMENTS.  тHIS WILL WORK JUSTFINE WITH "ZIPPED" FILES CREATED WITHVERSION 1.тO AVOID HEARTACHE, LOST CREDITS, ANDWASTED DOWNLOAD TIME IT IS стронглыRECOMMENDED THAT YOU MAKE BACK-UPS OFANY ARCHIVE FILE бефоре YOU ATTEMPT TODISSOLVE IT!  сOME OF THE ARCHIVEPROGRAMS, SUCH AS лынь, DESTROY THEARCHIVE FILE AND AN INTERRUPTEDATTEMPT AT DISSOLVING COULD MEAN ARUINED FILE.(C) йANUARY 1990 фANDф пRODUCTSпERMISSION TO REPRINT IS GRANTED        PROVIDED THE FILE IS PRINTED IN IT'SENTIRETY.ноте фром пинацолада:тHERE ARE TWO OTHER ARCHIVE FORMATSTHAT HAVE NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THISARTICLE.  тHEY ARE .жсд AND .сфьARCHIVES..жсд STANDS FOR жISION сELF-дISSOLVING.вRITTEN BY THE AUTHORS OF жISION ббс,THIS IS A HANDY FORMAT TO USE, AS IT ISBOTH SELF-DISSOLVING анд DEVICE/DRIVESELECTABLE. тHIS ALLOWS HARD DRIVEOWNERS TO DISSOLVE TO A PARTICULARPARTITION ON THEIR HARD DRIVE IF THEYWISH..сфь STANDS FOR сELф-EьTRACTING. иTUSES A 16-BIT црц CHECKSUM TO PACK THEARCHIVE.
