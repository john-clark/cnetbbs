Image 2000 Beta 1 Install Instructions:

The BBS is setup for drive 9, so keep that in mind when you copy the files to your drive or partition.  If you need to have another drive setup for your files, please contact me and I'll either customize it for your needs or tell you how to adjust it.  The final release will have customizing files.

It is also recommended you run this BBS package on a Hard Drive.  I plan to compact the system later for disk drive use.  1581's will work, but a 1541 or 1571 is not recommended.  Due to the space need.  If you want to run the system on a disk drive I would suggest you getting the Offline Reader System for Image 2000.  This will give you everything you need to get familiar with Image.

The current package is zipped and will dissolve into six d64 1541 disk images.  I had to use this option, hopefully by the final release I'll be able to use a better system.  For the sake of compatiblity 1541 disks are as common as you can get.

Unzip files
Use the d64it file included to convert the d64 images to 1541 disks.  You can also use 1541 partitions on a CMD hd.  You'll have to figure out how to use the file as I did.
Convert images to disk
Copy files to single partition on HD
Set HD for drive 9
Load Image Boot

The BBS is currently setup for a USR 14.4k modem.  I would recommend a USR modem product for high speed since they seem to always be the most compatible.  If you want to setup other modems, please contact me as I'll give you the files and instruction for them.

This is the first beta release of more to come.  If you don't feel you can understand the system, please wait till the final release of Image 2000, or grab a copy of Image 1.2a and tinker with it.
