**REU’s and RAM Drives**

The RAM Devices refer to any unit for the 64 and 128 that plugs into the
RAM Expansion Port and contains extra RAM.

"C-Net Approved" RAM Expansion Units (REU’s):

- 1700
- 1764
- 1750
- 1750 Clone

"C-Net Approved" RAM Devices:

- CMD RAMLink
- CMD RAMDrive

Both the CMD RAMLink and CMD RAMDrive have their own special
DOS that sets up the RAM like a CMD HD or FD2000 and FD4000 drive.
No special RAMDOS is needed, therefore any file type may be used on
these units. You can actually run the whole BBS from these units and get
incredible speed. These units are highly recommended for any BBS system
for the 64 or 128.
