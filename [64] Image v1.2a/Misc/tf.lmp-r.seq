ÃOADING THESEFILES INTO MEMORY IS DONE WITH AVARIATION OF THE &,7,DEVICE COMMAND.‘HESE FILES ALSO CANNOT DUPLICATE ANYLINE RANGES WHICH ALREADY EXIST IN THEORIGINAL PLUS-FILE IN WHICH THEY ARETO BE LINKED.”OME THINGS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATIONWHEN USING MINI PLUS- FILES IS THATTHE FIRST LINE OF THE PROGRAM MUST BEHIGHER THAN THE LAST LINE OF THEORIGINAL PLUS FILE AND, IT MUST BE A“≈ÕARK.  ¡LSO, THE FIRST LINE OF THEMINI-PLUS FILE MUST NEVER BE CALLED,YOUR PHYSICAL PROGRAM SHOULD BEGIN ONTHE LINE FOLLOWING THE “≈Õ.  ¡ FEWOTHER THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED ARE THATTHE LAST LINE OF THE PROGRAM MUSTNEVER EXCEED LINE 999 AND SHOULD BE A“≈Õ ALSO, BE CAREFUL, NEVER LET THEPROGRAM FALL THROUGH TO THE LINE 1000RANGE OR YOU WILL RECEIVE AN’Œƒ≈∆'ƒ ”‘¡‘≈Õ≈Œ‘ ≈““œ“.  √URRENTLYIT IS RECOMMENDED THAT ANY DATASTATEMENTS YOUR PROGRAM MIGHT NEED BELOCATED AND READ FROM THE ORIGINALPLUS FILE (THEY CAN BE USED BUT IT'SRATHER COMPLEX) AND CONTAINED IN ORREAD FROM THE MINI- PLUS FILE.ÃOADING MINI-PLUS FILES INTO MEMORY ISFAIRLY SIMPLE, JUST SET A$ EQUAL TODRIVE/LU + FILENAME THEN USE THECOMMAND &,7,DEVICE,1 TO LOAD THE FILEINTO MEMORY.  ¬ELOW IS A TYPICAL SETUPFOR A PROGRAM USING MINI-PLUS FILES.LINE RANGE 1-899 (899 SHOULD BE A “≈Õ)LINE RANGE 900-999 (BOTH 900 AND 999    SHOULD BE “≈Õ'S)14 DR=.:GOSUB1010: A$=DR$+"+.ÕÕ."+B$:&,7,DV%,1:GOSUB1012: ONE%+1GOTO901:RETURN‘HE ABOVE SUBROUTINE WOULD PROPERLYSET THE VALUE OF DR TO 0 TO ALLOW THEFILE TO BE LOADED FROM THE DESIGNATEDDRIVE IN THE –ROGRAM ∆ILE SUBSYSTEM(DR WOULD BE SET TO 5 IF THIS WERE ASUBSYSTEM LIKE THE ‘URBO “ELS).  ŒEXT,IT WOULD OPEN THE ERROR CHANNEL TOTHAT DEVICE AND LOAD THE FILE NAMED INA$, CHECK THE ERROR CHANNEL THENEXECUTE LINE 901 IF Œœ ERROR WASENCOUNTERED IN THE LOAD.  Œœ‘≈: USINGTHIS SUBROUTINE TO LOAD AND ENTER THEFILE WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO EXIT THEMINI-FILE BACK TO THE MAIN FILE WITH A“≈‘’“Œ.  œTHERWISE, IT WILL PUTGARBAGE ON THE SYSTEM STACK.¡ FEW THINGS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTOCONSIDERATION WHEN USING MINI-PLUSFILES IS THAT THE MAIN PROGRAM SHOULDONLY CONTAIN OFTEN USED SUBROUTINESAND COMMANDS, ALL OTHER COMMANDSSHOULD BE PUT INTO MINI-PLUS FILES ANDCALLED AS NEEDED.  ¡ GOOD EXAMPLE OFTHIS IS ALL DISK RELATED ROUTINES ANDTHE MAIN COMMAND STACK BE LOCATED INTHE ORIGINAL PLUS FILE AND SMALLERLESS-USED, ONE- TIME COMMANDS BE PUTINTO THE MINI-PLUS FILES.(C)  UNE 1990 ∆AND∆ –RODUCTS–ERMISSION TO REPRINT IS GRANTED        PROVIDED THE FILE IS PRINTED IN IT'SENTIRETY.
