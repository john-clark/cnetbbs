ÔHIS OPTION ALSO IS EXTENDED TO ADD A FEW OTHER HANDY STATISTICS FOR THOSEWITH MAINTENANCE ACCESS ON THE SYSTEM.  ÔHE "ÁDD ÃREDITS" (ÁÃ) OPTION, WILLALLOW SUBOPS TO ADD UP TO 500 CREDITS TO ANY USER ON THE SYSTEM.

ÔHE NO CREDITS UNTIL   VALIDATED SYSTEM ALSO GIVES THE SYSOPTHE ABILITY TO GIVE THE USER ALL OR     PARTIAL CREDITS FOR HIS UPLOAD(S).ÖALIDATING FILES HAS ALSO BEEN MADE     EASIER FOR THE BUSIEST OF SYSOPS.  ×ITHTHE ADDITION OF THE "ÖALIDATE ÁLL" AND  "ÖALIDATE ÎEW" COMMANDS.ÔHE LAST DATE THAT A FILE WAS DOWNLOADED HAS ALSO BEEN ADDED TO THE SYSTEM.ÔHIS IS GREAT FOR FINDING THE WORTHLESS FILES WHICH CAN BE DELETED BUT, WASACTUALLY INSTALLED FOR AN AUTO          MAINTENANCE SYSTEM WHICH WILL BESTARTED UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE ÓÉÇ  WORK.ÔHE "ÁBOUT" FUNCTION HAS ALSO TAKEN A   NEW LOOK WITH ADDED COMMANDS LIKE"ÅDIT", "ÖALIDATE", "ÕNVALIDATE", AND   THE ABILITY TO SEND E-MAIL TO THEUPLOADER OF THE FILE.ÌOCAL MODE UPLOADING HAS ALSO BEEN MADE EASIER WITH THE LOCAL MODE "MULTI-UPLOAD" FUNCTION, WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU  TO ADD ANY FILE(S) ON THE DESIGNATEDDRIVE TO THE SUB DIRECTORY QUICKLY AND  EASILY.ÔHE ÕØ HASN'T REALLY CHANGED MUCH EXCEPT FOR THE ADDITION OF THE "ÅVERY"FUNCTION TO THE MULTI-DOWNLOAD MENU.    ÔHIS OPTION WILL ALLOW YOU TO DOWNLOADALL FILES WHICH MEET THE ORIGINAL       PATTERN ENTERED, AND COMPUTE THE TOTALESTIMATED D/L TIME.ÔHAT SHOULD JUST ABOUT COVER ALL THE    BEST FEATURES OF THIS NEW SYSTEM OTHERTHAN THE FACT THAT, JUST LIKE ÉÍÁÇÅ     ITSELF, IT WAS WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAYTHAT IT CAN BE EASILY ADDED TO, OR      MODIFIED, BY JUST ABOUT ANYONE WITH ALITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SYSTEM.(C) ÍARCH 1990 ÆANDÆ ÐRODUCTSÐERMISSION TO REPRINT IS GRANTED        PROVIDED THE FILE IS PRINTED IN IT'SENTIRETY.
