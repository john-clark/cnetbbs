ÓOMETHING THAT WE PUT IN AND    THEN KIND OF 'FORGOT' ABOUT.  ÁT LEASTÉ DID UNTIL É WENT LOOKING FOR IT THE   OTHER DAY.ÔHE "+.ER" PROGRAM HAS BEEN REWORKED BY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AND ONE OF THEADDITIONS TO IT IS THE ABILITY TO SEND  EMAIL TO THE USER ON-LINE IF/WHEN ANERROR IS GENERATED.  ÔO ACTIVATE THIS   'FEATURE' YOU NEED TO CREATE A FILECALLED "S.ERRMAIL" ON YOUR "S.FILE"     DISK.  ÉF YOU CREATE THAT FILE TOCONTAIN THE MESSAGE YOU WANT SENT TO THE USER WHEN AN ERROR IS GENERATED THESYSTEM WILL DO THE REST.ÂASICALLY YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE: "×HILE YOU WERE ON MY SYSTEM AN ERROR   WAS CREATED, WOULD YOU LEAVE ME AMESSAGE TELLING ME WHAT YOU WERE DOING  SO THAT É CAN FIND THE ERROR?"ÁND SAVE THAT AS "S.ERRMAIL".ÁND HERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER LITTLE   MINOR DETAILS.  ÙOU NO LONGER NEED THEFILE "E.ERRMSG", A RELATIVE FILE ON YOUR "ETCETERA" DISK.  ÎOR DO YOU NEED THEFILE "U.ALPHA" IF YOU ARE RUNNING "1.1" OR HIGHER.  ÙOU ALSO WILL NOT NEED"+.ALPHA" UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME PLAN TO  RETURN TO VERSION "1.0".×HILE WE ARE ON "UNDOCUMENTED" ITEMS,   YOU MIGHT WANT TO PLAY WITH A COUPLE OFADDED PRINT MODES.  ÔHE \\P9 AND \\PJ   WERE ADDED FOR "1.1", AND A COUPLEMORE, \\PK AND \\PL WERE ADDED FOR      "1.2".  ÔHESE FOUR ARE COMPANION MODES.ÔHEY PRINT ÄÉÁÇÏÎÁÌÌÙ.  \\P9 PRINTS     DIAGONAL DOWN, LEFT TO RIGHT, \\PJPRINTS DIAGONAL ÕÐ, LEFT TO RIGHT.  \\PK PRINTS DIAGONAL DOWN FROM RIGHT TOLEFT, \\PL PRINTS DIAGONAL UP, RIGHT TO LEFT.  ÆUN BUT CONFUSING.  ÂEST TO JUSTEXPERIMENT WITH THEM TO SEE WHAT EFFECTS YOU CAN CREATE.(C) ÆEBRUARY 1990 ÆANDÆ ÐRODUCTSÐERMISSION TO REPRINT IS GRANTED        PROVIDED THE FILE IS PRINTED IN IT'SENTIRETY.
