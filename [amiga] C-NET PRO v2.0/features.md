| _\*This feature was originally written by Kelly Cochran, and as he refused to allow the source and/or executables to be included with CNet/PRO, this feature has needed to be removed for the time being._

Each user may create as many folders as they like, with a sysop-defined limit of the total mail size and number of mails. For ease of use, users may choose to only have a single mail slot/folder (“InBox”) to reduce confusion, or many mail slots/folders to aid in classifying long-term email storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Archive Transformation:**

The ability for the SYSOP to automatically convert archives from any pre-defined archive format to any other archive format of the SYSOP’s choosing.<br>Each subboard’s default archive format is SYSOP configurable.<br>An example of this would be in the support of multiple computer platforms within your Files bases, such as:Â 

Â Amiga archives would default to the .LzX or .LhA archive formats for highest reliability and compatibility among Amiga users.<br>PC-Based archives would default to .ZIP files. Â 

File transformation can be configured (via XScripts) to use system RAM for the fastest processing speeds, or can be processed in a dedicated directory on the hard drive for added protection against loss of data, or simply to keep that 700Meg archive from overrunning your 32 Meg of available memory. 😉Â 

Â Custom XScripts can be created by the SYSOP for ANY AmigaDOS-based Archiver to transform ANY “Initial” archive type to ANY “Preferred” archive format, and to allow for virus-checking, addition of fileid.diz file descriptions or BBS ad text files, and MORE!Â |
| ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: Background file transformation, in which uploaded files are converted to the System Operator’s preference, separately configurable for each file conference/area. One file area may be selected to convert files to LHA format while another may be converted to ZIP or ARJ format for support of files formats of different/alternative platforms. Simultaneous transforming is implemented and the sysop has the ability to limit the number of simultaneous background transforms to allow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

File areas support both multiple hard drives and multiple drive partitions to suit your particular storage requirements. Individually configurable, each subboard can be set to use a single drive or partition to centralize related files, or spanned across multiple devices or partitions to allow greater total storage capacity.

Â 

CNet/_PRO_ will automatically store files on the drive or partition with the most available free space, eliminating worries about errors due to running out of available HD space on a single device, while enhancing the total available storage space without users ever needing to consider which drive they need to send their uploads to!Â |
